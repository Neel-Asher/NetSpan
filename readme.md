## 📌 What is Netspan?

**Netspan** is an interactive, visualization‑driven web application designed to help users **build graphs**, **run classic graph algorithms**, and **understand how they work internally** through step‑by‑step execution and real‑time visuals.

The project focuses on **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithms—specifically **Prim’s** and **Kruskal’s**—and allows users to:

- Visually see how each algorithm grows the MST
- Compare algorithm behavior and performance
- Learn algorithmic concepts through interaction rather than static code

Netspan is especially useful for **students**, **educators**, and **anyone learning graph theory or algorithms**.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔹 Prim’s Algorithm

- Grows the MST starting from a chosen node
- Always selects the minimum‑weight edge connecting the tree to a new node

### 🔹 Kruskal’s Algorithm

- Sorts all edges by weight
- Adds edges incrementally while avoiding cycles

Each algorithm is implemented with:

- Explicit internal state tracking
- Visualization‑friendly step execution
- Clear explanatory messages for each step

## 🧪 Why This Project Matters

This project goes beyond simply *implementing* algorithms:

- ✅ Focuses on **understanding**, not just results
- ✅ Demonstrates **real‑world frontend engineering practices**
- ✅ Uses **strict TypeScript** with production‑grade builds
- ✅ Designed for **learning, teaching, and demonstration**

It bridges the gap between **theoretical algorithms** and **interactive software systems**.
